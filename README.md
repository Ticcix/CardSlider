***Sliders have become a crucial part of web design, used to showcase content or images in an engaging and interactive way.*** As a beginner, creating a card slider can help you develop fundamental web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, responsive designs, and jаvascript event listeners.

These concepts are vital for front-end developers to understand and can be applied to various web development projects. So in this blog post, we will show you how to create a responsive draggable card slider in HTML, CSS, ,jаvascript And PHP,  which can be used to display images, products, user profiles, and other content.

In order to truly understand how a draggable card slider works, we won’t be using any external jаvascript libraries such as SwiperJs or Owl Carousel. Instead, we’ll be creating the slider from scratch using pure vanilla jаvascript, PHP ,  HTML, and CSS.

In order to make our slider easier and more flexible, we also created an adapted dll plugin, through which you can easily add, delete or correct information from the slide.
